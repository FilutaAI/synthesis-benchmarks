Thoughtful Solitaire is an easy-to-play variation of the popular solitaire game, Klondike (a.k.a. Patience).
Itâ€™s just like the original, but with one interesting revision: instead of starting the game with cards faced down,
they are turned up and clearly visible to the player. This makes it possible to know the exact location of each card during the game.
As a result, the player can more easily plan better plays to win more games.
The goal of Thoughtful Solitaire is to move each card, in ascending rank, to its respective card foundation.
Initially, all cards except the topmost one will be obscured in each row.
The player may drag a card of a particular suit color and rank underneath another card that is one rank greater
and of the opposite color to form a stack. Kings can only be moved to an empty spot on the board.
Stacks may also be moved around similarly. The player can also draw cards from the stock to assist in building stacks
or completing the foundations. The player wins the game when all 52 cards have been moved into the foundations in the correct order.
