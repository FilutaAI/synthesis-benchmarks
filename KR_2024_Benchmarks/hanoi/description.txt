There are 3 pegs (A,B,C) and a tower of disks on the first one
(A), with the smaller on the top and the bigger on the bottom.
The purpose of the puzzle is to move the whole tower from the
first peg (A) to the third (C), by moving only one disk every
time and by observing not to put a bigger disk atop of a smaller
one.
