This domain is originally from the learning part of IPC 2008. The domain involves parking cars on a street with N curb locations,
and where cars can be double-parked but not triple-parked. The goal is to find a plan to move from one configuration of parked
cars to another configuration, by driving cars from one curb location to another.
