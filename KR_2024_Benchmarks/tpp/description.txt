This is a relatively recent planning domain that has been investigating in operation research (OR) for several years.
The travelling purchase problem (TPP) is a known generalization of the travelling salesman problem, and is defined as follows.
We have a set of products and a set of markets. Each market is provided with a limited amount of each product at a known price.
The TPP consists in selecting a subset of markets such that a given demand of each product can be purchased, minimizing the
routing cost and the purchasing cost. This problem arises in several applications, mainly in routing and scheduling contexts,
and it is NP-hard. In OR, computing optimal or near optimal solutions for TPP instances is still an active research topic.
